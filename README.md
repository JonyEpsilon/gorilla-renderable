# Pink Gorilla Middleware [![GitHub Actions status |pink-gorilla/gorilla-renderable](https://github.com/pink-gorilla/gorilla-renderable/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pink-gorilla/gorilla-renderable/actions?workflow=CI)

- this project is part of [PinkGorilla Notebook](https://github.com/pink-gorilla/gorilla-notebook)
- data structures from clojure/clojurescript have to be converted to some kind
of visual repesentation so that the notebook can render them
- for all clojure/clojurescript datatypes default renderers are defined here
- custom data-types can implement the renderable protocol 
- the notebook receves the render-datastructure and renders it to the notebook cell.

```
(defprotocol Renderable
  (render [self]))
```

Clojure/Clojurescript Data => (render) => Renderable DataStructure => (render) => Notebook
